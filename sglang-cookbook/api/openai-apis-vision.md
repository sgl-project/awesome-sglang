# OpenAI APIs - Vision

SGLang provides OpenAI-compatible APIs to enable a smooth transition from OpenAI services to self-hosted local models. A complete reference for the API is available in the [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision). This tutorial covers the vision APIs for vision language models.

SGLang supports various vision language models such as Llama 3.2, LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, Gemma3 and [more](https://docs.sglang.ai/supported_models/multimodal_language_models.html).

As an alternative to the OpenAI API, you can also use the [SGLang offline engine](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/examples/runtime/engine/offline_batch_inference_vlm.py).

## Example Request for Single-Image Input

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url=f"http://localhost:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What is in this image?",
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/test/lang/example_image.png?raw=true"
                    },
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=300,
)

print_highlight(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Example Request for Multiple-Image Inputs

The server also supports multiple images and interleaved text and images if the model supports it.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url=f"http://localhost:{port}/v1", api_key="None")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/test/lang/example_image.png?raw=true",
                    },
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sgl-project/sglang/main/assets/logo.png",
                    },
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "I have two very different images. They are not related at all. "
                    "Please describe the first image in one sentence, and then describe the second image in another sentence.",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print_highlight(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
